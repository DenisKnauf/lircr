lircr (pronounced 'lurker') is a LIRC client library for Ruby. It's simple,
it's easy, it's fun. If you got LIRC, get lircr. I am not responsible if you
grow more hair on your index finger or thumb.
    
    require 'lirc'
    lirc = LIRC::Client.new
    event = lirc.next
    p event
    if event.name == "play"
        system "xmms", "/av/music/3.mod"
    end
